# parking_slot_booking

The mobile application that we are going to present will facilitate the civilians to book their parking
slots in a particular building like malls, complexes, etc in prior. This helps to avoid confusion among
the people regarding the availability of the parking slots.  Reservation of slots is achieved with an
advanced congestion control algorithm to provide fair chances of booking to every individual. Since vehicles
get parking slots in prior it reduces the time of waiting on the road which in turn free up the fast lanes.
By providing the availability of the parking slots the number of vehicles parked in public places will
reduce and eventually reduce traffic jams and chaos.

This is a submission for Smart City Hackathon 2021
